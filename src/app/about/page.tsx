            Hi, I&apos;m Gary. Despite being in my 30s and working in tech, I&apos;ve done a pretty poor job at financial 
            planning. Like many others, I&apos;ve been living paycheck to paycheck, not really thinking about the future. 
            Sure, I had some savings, but no real plan.
          </p>

            Then it hit me - I want to have a family someday. As I started crunching the numbers, I realized 
            I needed to make more money than I do now to support the lifestyle I want for my future family. 
            The costs of housing, childcare, education savings, and healthcare in major cities were eye-opening. 
            This wasn&apos;t just about saving a bit more - it was about completely rethinking my income goals.

            I couldn&apos;t find a tool that would help me visualize these financial goals in a clear, modern way. 
            Most calculators were either too simplistic or overwhelmingly complex. I wanted something that would:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-3 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
            <li>Show exactly how much I need to earn for different lifestyles</li>
            <li>Account for location-specific costs of living</li>
            <li>Factor in family planning and partner income</li>
            <li>Present everything in a visually appealing, easy-to-understand way</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
            I also wanted something I could put on my wall as a daily reminder.
            Sometimes the best motivation is having your goals stare you in the face every day.
